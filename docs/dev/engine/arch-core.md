# Core

The core is the foundation of the engine. Client, server, and shared game logic all build on it. The core gives every part of the engine the basic things it needs. This holds regardless of whether that part renders anything or talks to a network. The core manages file locations, process start and stop, error reporting, and a few small subsystems. Other, more game-specific parts of the engine use these subsystems.

## Process lifecycle

When the engine starts, it resolves three directories: the game data directory, the user data directory, and the mods directory. The user data directory location depends on the platform. The engine uses `%APPDATA%`, the XDG data directory, `$HOME`, or the current directory, in that order, as fallbacks. The engine mounts all three directories into one virtual filesystem. The user directory is writable. The engine searches the mods directory last. Other engine parts, such as configs, resources, and mods, read and write through this virtual filesystem. None of them touch the physical disk directly. On shutdown, the engine reverses these steps.

A few small pieces support this startup process. The engine parses command-line options once at startup. Other code can query these options by name, for example to pick a thread pool size. The engine also uses one exception convention, `vx::throw_if` and `throw_if_not`, for every failure case. This convention keeps error handling consistent across the codebase. Without it, each subsystem could invent its own method.

Resources and mods use namespaced identifiers, for example `mymod:some/thing`, instead of raw paths. The namespace maps to a mod. The engine reuses this identifier convention for blocks, biomes, sounds, and other moddable items.

## Configuration

The engine has two configuration stores.

The first store is `config::Map`. It is a generic key-value map with string keys. Code can bind a typed reference to a key. A subsystem uses this store for its own separate data, such as mod metadata and per-world save files. The map format is `key=value`.

The second store is the cvar host. It holds console variables and commands. A variable has a type, an optional default, a range or validator, flags and optional change hooks. A command has a help text and a callback. The host keeps every variable and command in one registry. The client and the server each fill their own registry during startup.

`cvar::exec_from` reads a command script. Each line is either `name value`, a command, or a comment that starts with `#`. `cvar::save_values` writes every `FCVAR_ARCHIVE` value, then calls the registered write hooks. The client uses `client.conf` for its settings and bindings; the server uses `server.conf`. The client loads `client.user.conf` after `client.conf`, so a user file can override the main file.

The startup order is: defaults and flags are set first, then the config file is loaded, then `init_late` applies the values that other subsystems depend on. The client loads both config files after every `init` and before `init_late`.

A server-owned variable can use `FCVAR_REPLICATED`. The server sends its value to clients as a shadow; clients cannot overwrite it while connected. The full list of variables is in [CVars](../../reference/cvars.md).

## Resources

Resource management is the engine's one loading and caching path for assets that mods reference. A resource type registers one loader for itself. After that, any code can request a resource of that type by identifier. The engine turns the identifier into a file path and looks it up. If the resource is already loaded, the request returns the existing instance. Otherwise, the request triggers a new load, and the engine keeps the result for later requests. A request can also ask the engine to hold a permanent reference to the result. This lets the resource survive even when nothing else holds it.

Purging follows a fixed memory policy, not a one-off cleanup call. A soft purge drops only the resources that nothing references anymore. It normally runs after every frame. A hard purge drops every resource regardless of use, and warns about each one still in use. That warning is a sign: something still holds memory the engine just freed.

## Threading

The engine pushes heavy, non-interactive work onto a background thread pool instead of running it inline. Examples of this work include world generation and chunk meshing, or any CPU-heavy task that would otherwise stall a frame. The pool size comes from the `threads` command-line option, and defaults to four workers.

The engine splits each piece of work into two parts. Computation runs on a worker thread. Any step that touches shared state, such as uploading a mesh or changing the world, waits until the computation finishes. The main loop checks, once per frame, which tasks have finished. For each finished task, it runs that second step on the main thread. This design removes the need for manual locking in most cases. On shutdown, the engine cancels any task that has not finished yet. It does not wait for the task, and it does not run the task's main-thread step.

## Buffers

Buffers are the engine's one shared binary format. Everything else uses buffers to describe bytes sent over the network or bytes saved to disk. The engine defines a small set of base types once: fixed-width integers, floats, strings, and vectors. Anything that needs serialization, such as network packets or saved data, is a sequence of these base types. The network protocol and the on-disk formats share this same vocabulary. Each format simply states which buffer field comes next. No format needs to redefine what a byte means.
