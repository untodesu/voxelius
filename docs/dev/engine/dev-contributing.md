# Contributing

Voxelius is a sandbox voxel game and engine written in C++20. This page describes how to send a change.

Read the [Code Style](dev-code-style.md) page before you start. Formatting and naming are part of the review. The [Build Guide](init-building.md) and the [Requirements](init-requirements.md) pages explain how to build the project. The [Editor Setup](init-editor.md) page configures the C/C++ engine in Visual Studio Code.

The project uses the BSD 3-Clause license. See `LICENSE`. A change that you send uses the same license.

## Before you start

- Open an issue for a large change: a new subsystem, a new file format, a change to the network protocol. Explain what you want to do and why. Wait for an answer before you write much code.
- Send a small fix directly. A typo, a crash, a wrong number: these need no discussion.
- Do not edit `deps/`. It holds vendored third-party code and its update scripts.
- Do not commit `build/`, `dist/`, `site/` or `.vscode/settings.json`. The build writes the first three, and the last one belongs to your machine.

## Making a change

- Make one logical change per commit. Do not mix a refactor with a change of behavior.
- Keep the change inside one area when you can. A commit that touches unrelated areas is hard to review.
- Format every changed C++ file with `clang-format` and the repository `.clang-format`. The [Code Style](dev-code-style.md) page lists the settings.
- Build the target that you change. Run the client or the server when the change can affect them.
- Change the documentation in the same commit when the change modifies a documented behavior. `properdocs.yml` lists the pages.

## Testing

There is no test suite. You test a change by building it and by running the game:

- Run the client for a change to rendering, the interface or the client systems.
- Run the server for a change to the world, entities, physics or the network.
- Run both sides against each other for a change to the network protocol or to the shared game logic. The two sides must agree on the block, biome, fluid, tint and entity registries.

Describe the test in the pull request. A reviewer cannot see your machine.

## Commit messages

### Subject

- Write the subject as one sentence that says what the change does.
- Start it with a capital letter. Do not end it with a period.
- Do not add a type or area prefix. A `core:` or a `feat:` prefix is not the style of this repository.
- Use the imperative mood when the sentence allows it: `Move worldgen code to server`, `Fix crashing`. A noun phrase is also correct: `Client connections`, `Checkpoint`.
- Keep the subject on one line. Put the details in the body.

> **NOTE:** Older commits use a `<area>: <summary>` prefix, for example `shared: test identifiers`. Do not copy that form.

### Body

Most commits need no body. Write one when the change has several parts, or when the subject does not show why the change is done.

- Write the body as a list of `- ` bullets, one per part of the change.
- Do not list the changed files. Do not repeat the subject.
- Keep the voice direct and informal. Read `git log` before you write.

### Trailers

Trailers go in the last paragraph of the message, after a blank line.

A commit that has material AI help gets an `Assisted-by:` trailer. Use the full lowercase model identifier, not only the model family:

```
Keep the config file open across a reload

Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-5-5
```

Do not add `Co-authored-by:` for AI tools.

## AI-assisted contributions

You can use AI tools, but a human drives the work:

- Review every line that a tool generates. Understand it well enough to explain it and to fix it.
- You are responsible for the change, as if you wrote all of it yourself.
- Unreviewed, bulk or fully automated changes are not accepted.
- Mark a commit that has material AI help with an `Assisted-by:` trailer (see [Trailers](#trailers)).

## Pull requests

- Open the pull request against the default branch.
- Describe what the change does and how you tested it. Do not repeat the diff.
- Keep one topic per pull request. A reviewer can ask for a split.
- Answer each review comment. Push the fix as a new commit.
- Do not rewrite the history of a branch that is under review.
- Rebase on the default branch when your branch conflicts with it.

## Reporting a problem

Open an issue and add:

- the steps that lead to the problem;
- what you expected and what happened;
- the build (debug or release), the platform and the version;
- the log output, when the engine wrote one.

Try to find the smallest series of steps that shows the problem. A report without a reproduction is hard to use.
