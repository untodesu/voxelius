# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents that work in this repository. This file is self-contained: it holds the whole project guide, so you need
no other file to follow the rules.

## Rules for agents

- Read this whole file before you change anything.
- Do not commit on your own. Leave changes in the working tree for review. Commit only when you are told to, and only to the active branch.
- Right before you write each commit message, read "Commit messages" below again, and check the message against it before you commit. Do not
  write commit messages from memory.
- Mark your commits with an `Assisted-by:` trailer as "Trailers" below describes. Never add `Co-authored-by:` for yourself. This rule
  overrides the default attribution of your tool.
- Format every changed C++ file with `clang-format` and build the affected target before you hand the change over.
- Keep the change inside the code that the request names. Do not edit `deps/` or `build/`: the first holds vendored code and the second
  holds generated files.

## About Voxelius

Voxelius is a sandbox voxel game and engine written in C++23 and built with CMake. Engine code is C++23. The vendored dependencies are C99.
The client draws with OpenGL 3.3 core profile through SDL3 and builds its interface with Dear ImGui. The server is headless. The two sides
talk over ENet, a reliability layer on top of UDP. Game entities use EnTT. Mods are Lua scripts that call the engine API.

Four CMake targets make up the project. `core` is the foundation library: process lifecycle, the virtual filesystem, configs, resources,
threading and buffers. `shared` holds the game logic that both sides run: the world, entities, physics, the network protocol and the mod
loader. `client` and `server` build the `vclient` and `vserver` executables.

`data/` is the content that ships with the game, starting with the `builtin` mod. `docs/` is the documentation site. `scripts/` holds the
build, packaging and editor helpers. `misc/` holds small generators for data assets.

## AI-assisted contributions

You can use AI tools, but a human drives the work:

- Review every line that a tool generates. Understand it well enough to explain it and to fix it.
- You are responsible for the change, as if you wrote all of it yourself.
- Unreviewed, bulk or fully automated changes are not accepted.
- Mark a commit that has material AI help with an `Assisted-by:` trailer (see "Trailers" below).

## Building

Every build uses a CMake preset. A preset configures into `build/<preset>/` and names one platform, one configuration and, when it ends
in `-prof`, profiling:

|Platform|Presets|
|----|----|
|Any POSIX host|`generic-debug`, `generic-release`, and a `-prof` variant of each|
|Windows x64|`windows-x64-debug`, `windows-x64-release`, and a `-prof` variant of each|
|Windows x86|`windows-x32-debug`, `windows-x32-release`, and a `-prof` variant of each|

```sh
cmake --preset windows-x64-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-x64-debug
```

- `scripts/build-*.bat` and `scripts/build-*.sh` wrap one preset each, from configure to build.
- The `-prof` presets define `TRACY_ENABLE`, `TRACY_ON_DEMAND` and `TRACY_NO_FRAME_IMAGE`. Use them with the Tracy profiler. A normal
  build must not define them.
- On Windows with MSVC, `deps/SDL3` downloads the SDL3 3.4.12 development package into `build/<preset>/_deps/` at configure time. Every
  other dependency is in the tree, so a build after the first needs no network access.
- A C++23 compiler, a C99 compiler, CMake 3.25 or newer and Python 3 are enough. The presets use schema version 6, so an older CMake
  cannot read them. Python runs the third-party license collector and the asset generators.
- The executables land in `build/<preset>/`. A multi-configuration generator such as Visual Studio adds the configuration directory:
  `build/<preset>/Debug/vclient.exe`.
- No workflow compiles the game. `.github/workflows/documentation.yml` builds the documentation site only, so a compile error is yours to
  find.

## Running

Run the executables from the repository root. The default game content path is `data`, relative to the working directory:

```sh
build/windows-x64-debug/vclient.exe
build/windows-x64-debug/vserver.exe
```

- `-gamepath <path>` points the engine at another content directory.
- `-user <path>` points it at another user directory. The default is a per-user directory taken from `%APPDATA%`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or
  `$HOME`, in that order. The engine keeps the configs, the world and the server whitelist there.
- Both sides mount the content, the user directory and the mods directory into one virtual filesystem. A test run therefore writes nothing
  into the repository.

There is no test suite. Verify a change by building it and by running the client, the server, or both. A change to the network protocol
needs both sides.

## Code style

`docs/dev/engine/dev-code-style.md` is the reference. The rules below are the ones that a change most often breaks.

### Formatting

Format C++ with `clang-format` and the `.clang-format` in the repository root: 4 spaces, 140 columns, CRLF line endings, `T* p`, and the
opening brace of a function on its own line. The tree is formatted with clang-format 21. An older version can format some constructs
differently.

- `deps/**` is excluded by `.clang-format-ignore`.
- Check changed files with `clang-format --dry-run --Werror <files>`.
- If the result looks wrong, split the code into smaller chunks. Do not edit `.clang-format` first.

### Language

- Use C++23. Prefer the standard facility over a hand-written one: `std::bit_cast`, `std::span`, `std::format`, concepts,
  `std::source_location`.
- Report a failure through `vx::throw_if` or `vx::throw_if_not` from `core/exception.hh`. Both throw a `vx::runtime_error` with the source
  location of the call. Use `assert` only for a condition that must hold in a debug build.
- `main` catches every exception, logs it and returns a failure code. Do not add a second top-level handler.
- Mark a class or structure `final` unless it is a base.
- A function with no parameters writes `(void)`.
- Put the body of a `constexpr` function in the header, right after its declaration.
- Close a namespace with `} // namespace name`. clang-format enforces the comment.
- An intentionally empty body holds `// empty`.

### Names

|Kind|Style|Example|
|----|----|----|
|Files|`snake_case`|`shared/block_storage.cc`|
|Namespaces|`snake_case`|`namespace block_storage`|
|Classes and structures|`PascalCase`|`class ReadBuffer`|
|Functions and methods|`snake_case`|`block_registry::name_of()`|
|Public fields and members|`snake_case`|`BlockDefinition::model_offset`|
|Private fields and members|`m_snake_case`|`Chunk::m_blocks`|
|Constants|`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`|`BASE_WIDTH`|

### Headers and includes

- Headers use `.hh`, sources use `.cc`. A C source keeps `.c`.
- Every header has a GUID-style include guard. Dashes become underscores. `#pragma once` is not used. End the block with the same token in
  a block comment:

  ```cpp
  #ifndef B843EAA9_60C3_4C2B_8036_DF1026035AA8
  #define B843EAA9_60C3_4C2B_8036_DF1026035AA8

  // ...

  #endif /* B843EAA9_60C3_4C2B_8036_DF1026035AA8 */
  ```

- Every compiled source includes the precompiled header of its module first: `#include "client/pch.hh"`, `#include "shared/pch.hh"` or
  `#include "core/pch.hh"`. The build force-includes the same file, so the include is redundant to the compiler. Keep it anyway: it is
  what an editor reads first and what the module owns.
- Sort the other includes by dependency: `core`, then `shared`, then `client` or `server`. clang-format sorts each group.
- Do not edit `deps/`. A new dependency follows the shape of the current ones: a `deps/<name>/` directory, a `CMakeLists.txt` there that
  defines `deps::<name>`, and an entry in `deps/CMakeLists.txt`.

### Comments

- Use `//`. Comment sparingly and explain the reason that the code does not show. Do not restate what the code does.
- An empty body is marked `// empty`.
- Keep the tone of the comments around you. Jokes and profanity in the existing comments are part of the history of the project.

## Repository map

|Directory|Contents|
|----|----|
|`core/`|Foundation library. `config/` is the typed key-value store, `res/` the resource loader, `utils/` the small helpers|
|`shared/`|Game logic for both sides. `api/` the Lua API, `component/` and `entity/` the EnTT pieces, `net/` the packets, `physics/`, `system/`, `world/`|
|`client/`|`vclient`. `gui/` the menus, `net/` the connection, `res/` the render resources, `system/` the frame systems, `world/` the renderer|
|`server/`|`vserver`. `entity/`, `net/`, `system/`, `utils/`, `world/`|
|`data/`|Content that ships with the game: `builtin` mod, shaders, textures, language files|
|`deps/`|Vendored third-party code and its CMake glue|
|`docs/`|Documentation site sources|
|`scripts/`|Build, package and editor helpers|
|`misc/`|Small image and model generators|

### Architecture

- **Startup.** `core` resolves three directories: game content, user data and mods. It mounts all three into one PhysFS virtual filesystem.
  The user directory is writable, and every subsystem reads and writes through that filesystem instead of the disk.
- **Identifiers.** A moddable thing is named `mod:some/thing`, not by a path. Blocks, biomes, sounds, resources and textures use the same
  convention.
- **Resources.** One loader is registered per resource type. A request by identifier returns the cached instance or loads it. A soft purge
  drops what nothing references, a hard purge drops everything and warns about what was still in use.
- **Threading.** Heavy work goes to a background pool. Each task has a compute step on a worker thread and a finish step on the main
  thread, so most code needs no lock. `-threads` sets the pool size, with a default of four.
- **Buffers.** One binary format describes both network packets and saved data. A format is a sequence of the same base types.
- **Rendering.** The client renders at an internal pixel scale into three layers (diffuse, alpha, fluid), composites them, and draws ImGui
  last. `video` owns the window; `head` owns the OpenGL context, so the context can be rebuilt without the window.
- **Networking.** Every packet starts with a 16-bit ID. A client does either a status ping or a full login. The login uses an Ed25519
  challenge and compares the registry hashes of both sides.

`docs/dev/engine/` describes each of these in full.

## Editor and code intelligence

The repository ships a setup script for both C/C++ engines in VS Code. Run it after the first configure:

|Shell|clangd|IntelliSense|
|----|----|----|
|Windows PowerShell|`.\setup_clangd.ps1`|`.\setup_intellisense.ps1`|
|Windows cmd.exe|`setup_clangd.bat`|`setup_intellisense.bat`|
|POSIX shell|`./setup_clangd.sh`|`./setup_intellisense.sh`|

If the Windows execution policy blocks a PowerShell script, use the `.bat` wrapper or run the Python file directly:
`py -3 scripts/setup_environment.py clangd`.

- `clangd` is the default. The script turns off the analysis of the Microsoft extension, keeps its debugger, and copies
  `build/<preset>/compile_commands.json` to `build/compile_commands.json`, where clangd finds it.
- Add `--preset <name>` to pick the preset whose database to copy. Without it the script takes the most recently configured one.
- The `intellisense` mode writes `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` from the presets and the dependency tree.
- `.vscode/settings.json` and `build/` are ignored by git. `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` is tracked and holds only workspace-relative
  paths.
- `.clangd` in the repository root holds the project-wide clangd switches. It stops the include cleaner from reporting the module
  precompiled header as unused, and it parses headers as C++23.
- CMake writes a compilation database only for the Ninja and Makefile generators. The Visual Studio generator writes none, so clangd
  needs one Ninja configure:

  ```sh
  cmake -S . -B build/clangd -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
  ```

## Commit messages

- Make one logical change per commit.
- Write the subject as one sentence that says what the change does. Start it with a capital letter and do not end it with a period.
- Do not add a type or area prefix. A `core:` or a `feat:` prefix is not the style of this repository.
- Use the imperative mood when the sentence allows it: `Move worldgen code to server`, `Fix crashing`. A noun phrase is also correct:
  `Client connections`, `Checkpoint`.
- Keep the subject on one line. Put the details in the body.
- Most commits need no body. Write one when the change has several parts, or when the subject does not show why the change is done. A body
  is a list of `- ` bullets, one per part. Do not list the changed files and do not repeat the subject.
- The voice is direct and informal. Read `git log` before you write and keep the tone of the history. Do not write in the tone of a report.

### Trailers

Trailers go in the last paragraph of the message, after a blank line.

- A commit that has material AI help gets an `Assisted-by:` trailer in the form `AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION`. Use the full lowercase model
  identifier, not only the model family:

  ```
  Keep the config file open across a reload

  Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-5-5
  ```

- Do not add `Co-authored-by:` for AI tools.

## Documentation

- `docs/` is the documentation site, built with properdocs. `properdocs.yml` holds the navigation.
- `docs/dev/engine/` describes the engine: requirements, source hierarchy, build guide, editor setup, architecture, code style and
  contribution process. `docs/dev/modding/` describes the mod API and the file formats.
- `docs/dev/engine/dev-contributing.md` describes how a change is sent: patches, pull requests, commit messages and trailers. Keep it in
  step with the rules in this file.
- Change the page that describes the behavior you change, in the same commit. A new page needs an entry in `properdocs.yml`.
- Build the site with `pip install -r requirements.txt` once, then `properdocs build --site-dir build/www`.
